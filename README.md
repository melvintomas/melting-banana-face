# Melting Banana Face
Demo RESTful API excerise

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Node.js
NPM  

### Installation
Run `npm install` to get required package dependancy
Use `npm run` to start the API on port 3000

## Built With
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js

## Assumptions
- Agent and Customer schemas are explicitly defined with no flexible or extendable fields
- Agent ID, Customer ID, and Customer GUID cannot be modified
- No other endpoint are needed besides the 9 listed requirements
- Datasources will eventually be moved into a database
- Validation will eventually be added based on requirements
- Sensitive Personal Identifiable Data will be secured
- API endpoints will eventually support pagination(have record counts, limits,link to prev/next page) to prevent overwhelming resource

## Additional Requirement Questions

- Who is authorized to access this senstive data and what methods to use to secure data?
- What are the requirements for the individual fields (required fields, min/max length, default values)?
- Which fields need to be exposed to the API and which can be hidden
- Do we need an endpoint to delete an Agent?
- Do we need an endpoint to get a customer by ids?
- Do we a need both PUT/PATCH http methods to disthinguish between update all fields or specified fields
